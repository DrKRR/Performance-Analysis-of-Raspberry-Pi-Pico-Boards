# Benchmark-Performance-Analysis-of-Raspberry-Pi-Pico-Boards
This document provides Benchmark and Performance Analysis of Raspberry Pi Pico Boards
## Introduction:
An analysis of experimental results comparing the execution performance of Fibonacci number calculations, as a part of benchmarking across various Raspberry Pi Pico boards is carried out in this work. The resuts focus on ARM Cortex-M0, ARM Cortex-M33 and RISC-V cores, as implemented in the RP2040 (Raspberry Pi Pico and Raspberry Pi Pico W) and RP2350 (Raspberry Pi Pico 2) microcontrollers. Experiments are carried out using the recent MicroPython firmwares loaded in appropriate boards: [Ref](https://micropython.org/download) (screen shots given below). program is developed in MicroPython using Thonny editor.
